# Awesome Interactive Papers

A curated collection of interesting research papers transformed into interactive single-page HTML web experiences for better engagement and understanding. Each paper is presented as a standalone HTML file with embedded interactivity using inline JavaScript, CSS, and libraries (e.g., via CDNs for D3.js or other tools).

## About the Project

This repository hosts a selection of fascinating papers from various fields (e.g., AI, computer science, physics, etc.). Instead of plain PDFs, I've converted them into single-file interactive HTML pages for simplicity and easy sharing.

The goal is to make academic reading more accessible and fun. Browse the papers below, or contribute your own recommendations!

## Papers

Here’s a list of the papers currently available. Click on the links to view the interactive HTML files directly (e.g., via GitHub Pages, raw view, or local opening in a browser).

- **[Paper Title 1](papers/TiDar_2025.html)**: TiDAR: Think in Diffusion, Talk in Autoregression. (Field: AI, Year: 2025)

More papers coming soon! If you have suggestions, see the Contribution section.
